1. each file can contain only one public class
2. filename should match the class name, including case and have a .java extension
3. if that class is the entry point of the program, it must contain a vvalid main() method

Packages:
packages are logical grouping of the clases.
java.lang package is default imported for all java classes.. and thats how we could use System.out in our code without any import statements..

to compilse classes and place in a package structred folders..
javac -d class ClassA.java ClassB.java ClassC.java

to run the code from the package structure.. 
java -cp classes packageb.ClassB 

-d  -> directory in which the generated classes need to be placed
-cp -> location of classes needed to compile the program

to bind a folder full of classes into a jar file..
jar cf MyApp.jar -C classes .

for running a jar file by providing the main clas name..
java -cp MyApp.jar packageb/ClassB
